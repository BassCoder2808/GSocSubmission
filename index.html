			<h1>Deliverables</h1>
			<p>
				The primary objective of this project is to improve the functionality of the existing online tool,
				thereby increasing the efficiency of license submissions. By doing so, we intend to reduce the workload
				of the SPDX-legal team and ensure that the entire process is streamlined and hassle-free. Our ultimate
				goal is to create a user-friendly platform that simplifies license submission, saves time, and enhances
				overall productivity.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Generate the .txt test file in the pull request (PR) along with the XML file:</strong> This
					feature will
					enhance the current capability of the tool to create the XML file by also creating a .txt test file
					in the PR, thus making the submission process more efficient.</li>
				<li><strong>Differentiate exceptions from license submissions:</strong> The tool will be able to
					differentiate between
					exceptions and license submissions, which will improve the overall efficiency of the process.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Add or fix unit tests & Improve error handling:</strong> This feature will ensure that the
					tool is
					functioning properly, and any errors are caught early in the process. Error handling will be
					improved, especially when GitHub pull requests fail, which will reduce manual intervention and
					increase the tool's efficiency.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Write GitHub tests with mocks</li>
					<li>Separate tests in multiple files</li>
					<li>Adding tests for edge</li>
					<li>Tests for UI on browser e.g.: Chrome</li>
				</ul>
				<li><strong>Add linters to the project - python/js/html/css linters:</strong> This will ensure that the
					code adheres to
					the coding standards and best practices, leading to better code quality.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>General UI Improvements:</strong> This will help the application be more user-friendly and
					will make the app
					more accessible. Issues which I have planned to cover in this:
					<ul>
						<li>Redirect on Successful License Submission</li>
						<li>Improving the Toast Messages</li>
						<li>Improving the License Text Display on GitHub Issue Section</li>
					</ul>

	<!-- Project Summary -->
	<div class="award section second" id="ProjectSummary">
		<div class="container">
			<h1>Development<br>Summary</h1>
			<!-- We developed a Web based Application with a consideration to use open source Technologies. The Application
			was created on a Three tier architecture with Light front end tier, all business functionality included in
			the Middle tier and Database as the Data Tier.
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Front end Tier:</strong> Front end was developed using the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery,
					Boot strap, Chart.js. The images are taken from <a href="https://www.freepik.com/">Adobe stock.<a>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Middle Tier:</strong> the Business logic was developed on Python Django.</li>
				<li><strong>Back End/ Data Layer:</strong> SQLite was the database we choose to persist the data.</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			<p>Modules were created in the application with provisioning the User management, License data management,
				UI Analytics. Each of the Modules is explained in detail in the below sections.</p>

			<p> -->
			<h3>Generate the .txt file in the PR along with the XML File</h3>
			<br>
			To implement this feature, we would need to make changes to the current codebase of the SPDX online tool.
			When a user submits a new license request through the tool, the tool generates an XML file and submits a PR
			to the SPDX License List GitHub repository. To generate a .txt test file in addition to the XML file, we
			would need to modify the existing code to extract the necessary information from the user's input and create
			a text file with the required details.
			<br />
			<p>
				To achieve this, we would need to modify the following files:
			<ol>
				<li><strong>`views.py`:</strong>
					This file is responsible for handling the submission of new license requests through the tool. We
					would need to modify this file to
				</li>
				<li><strong>`generateXml.py`:</strong>
					This file is responsible for generating the XML file for each license request. We would need to
					modify this file to extract the necessary information from the user's input and use it to generate
					the .txt test file.
					<!-- <ul>
						<li>User Role Maintenance: Create, Modify and Delete User Roles.</li>
						<li>User Maintenance: Create, Modify and Delete Users. Each User in the system would be
							associated to one or more Roles.</li>
						<li>Super set of Other Roles: Admin User can act as an Uploader, Approver and Publisher which
							means all the functionalities available for these roles would be available to Admin role as
							well.</li>
						<li>Override Status: Admin Role has access to all the License data and Status and can change it
							directly in the system at any point in time. He can override the Process and update the
							license status.</li>
					</ul> -->
				</li>
				<!-- <li><strong>Uploader Role:</strong>
					User with the uploader Role can perform the following actions:
					<ul>
						<li>Upload a new License into the system and submit for approval.</li>
						<li>View all Licenses in the System.</li>
						<li>Modify Licenses which are in status New and Rejected.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Approver Role:</strong>
					User with the Approver Role can perform the following actions:
					<ul>
						<li>View all Licenses in the System.</li>
						<li>Approve a New License/ Rejected License that is submitted for approval.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li><strong>Publisher Role:</strong>
					User with the Publisher Role can perform the following actions:
					<ul>
						<li>View all Licenses in the System.</li>
						<li>Publish one or more Approved Licenses in the system.</li>
					</ul>
				</li> -->
			</ol>
			</p>

			<p>
			<h3>Differentiate Exceptions from License Submission</h3>
			<br>
			To implement this feature, we will need to add a checkbox in the submission form to indicate whether the
			submission is for a license or an exception. This will allow the tool to differentiate between a license and
			an exception and use the appropriate tag when creating the XML file and the pull request.
			<br />
			To achieve this, we will first modify the submission form to include the checkbox, which will then be
			included in the POST request sent to the server. We will then modify the server code to process the checkbox
			and use the appropriate tag when creating the XML file.
			<p>
				<!-- <ol>
				<li><strong>License Upload</strong>
					This Module covers the Functionalities around the License Upload Flow.
					<img src="img/licenseUpload.png"><br>
					The list of processes the new License data goes through are detailed as below. Only when a step is
					successful, data is passed on to the next step, incase of any validation Error the error is thrown
					back to the user.
					<ul>
						<li>Mandatory Field Validations:
							The Mandatory fields in the License entry form are validated here.
							<ul>
								<li>Canonicalization:
									The requirements are not finalized. We are approaching this problem in two steps as
									part of this version:
								</li>
								<li>The license data is simplified according to SPDX License List Matching Guidelines,
									v2.1 (https://spdx.dev/license-list/matching-guidelines/ ) where Guidelines 3,
									Guidelines 4, Guidelines 5, Guidelines 8, Guidelines 9 and Guidelines 13 have been
									implemented.
								</li>
								<li>De-Duplication:
									This process checks if the license that is uploaded already exists in the system.
									The validation is based on the License contents and certain key fields
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>License Approve</strong>
					<img src="img/licenseApprove.png"><br>
					The list of processes in the License Approval flow is included in this process. User selects the
					lists of Available licenses for approval, these would include new Licenses submitted for approval OR
					rejected licenses modified and submitted for approval.
				</li>

				<li><strong>License Publish</strong>
					<img src="img/licensePublish.png"><br>
					This flow includes process to Publish the Approved files in the system. User selects Approved
					licenses in the system and publishes them. There would be an option to Edit OR Add the Header fields
					before the data is exported.
				</li>

				<li><strong>Change Tracking</strong>
					<img src="img/tracking.png"><br>
					Every change in the License data is tracked in the system. Every action/ change is associated with a
					change code and the License file with changes in tracked at the database level. There is an UI to
					check the list of changes that has undergone for each License file.
				</li>

			</ol> -->
				<br>
			<h3>Add or fix unit tests & Improve error handling</h3>
			<p>
				<!-- This module includes all the Analytical reports included in the system. Each user role has access to
				specific reports. The reports is explained below: -->
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong></strong>Write GitHub tests with mocks:</strong>
					<br />
					To write tests for GitHub API interaction with mock, we will be using the `requests-mock` package.
					This package allows us to mock requests to any external APIs, including GitHub APIs.
					To start, we will create a new Python file named `test_github.py` in the tests directory. In this
					file, we will import the necessary modules and create a test class for the GitHub API tests. We will
					then create methods for each test case that we want to run.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong></strong>Separate tests in multiple files:</strong>
					<br />
					To separate the current tests for different features, we can create separate files for each feature.
					For example, we can create a file named `test_license.py` for license related tests and another file
					named `test_ui.py` for UI tests. Another example would be if there are tests for the XML creator
					feature, those tests should be in a file named `test_xml_creator.py`.
					We can then run all the tests using a test runner like` pytest` by specifying the directory where
					the test files are located. Here is an example command to run all the tests in the tests directory.
					This makes it easier to manage the tests.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong></strong>Adding tests for edge cases:</strong>
					<br />
					To add tests for edge cases, we need to identify the possible scenarios that may cause issues in our
					application. For example, we can add tests for license submissions with invalid data, or for
					exceptions that do not follow the SPDX format.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong></strong>Tests for UI on browser e.g.: Chrome:</strong>
					<br />
					To add UI tests, we can use a testing framework like `Selenium`. Selenium allows us to automate
					browser interactions and test the functionality of our web application.
					<br />
					For testing the UI on a browser like Chrome, we can make use of an automated testing framework like
					Selenium. Selenium allows us to automate the testing of web applications by simulating user
					interactions with the web page. We can write tests in Python using the `Selenium WebDriver API`.
					<br />
					To implement this feature, we need to install Selenium and the ChromeDriver executable. ChromeDriver
					is a separate executable that WebDriver uses to control Chrome. Once installed, we can write a
					Python test script that uses the Selenium WebDriver API to interact with the web application.
				</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Add linters to the project</h3>
			<p>
				<!-- This module includes all the Analytical reports included in the system. Each user role has access to
				specific reports. The reports is explained below: -->
				Linters are tools that help identify and report errors in code, helping to ensure that the codebase is
				of a high quality and follows best practices. The SPDX Online Tools project could benefit from the
				addition of linters for Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which would help to identify and fix issues
				in the codebase.
				<br>
				Python linters such as Pylint, Flake8, and Pyflakes can help to identify errors, potential bugs, and
				code smells in Python code. JavaScript linters like ESLint can detect issues such as unused variables,
				missing semicolons, and incorrect variable scoping. HTML linters like HTMLHint can check for issues such
				as invalid markup and accessibility errors. Finally, CSS linters like Stylelint can help identify errors
				such as invalid selectors, unused styles, and syntax errors.
				<br>
				The linters could be integrated into the development process, either through the use of pre-commit hooks
				or as part of a continuous integration (CI) pipeline. When a developer commits code, the linters would
				run and report any issues. This would help to catch errors early in the development process, before they
				become larger problems.
				The use of linters can also help to improve the readability and maintainability of the codebase. By
				enforcing consistent coding styles and conventions, the codebase becomes easier to read and understand,
				and easier to maintain over time.
				<br>
				Overall, the addition of linters to the SPDX Online Tools project would help to ensure that the codebase
				is of a high quality and follows best practices, while also improving the readability and
				maintainability of the codebase.

	<!-- Challenges -->
	<div class="work section second" id="Challenges">
		<div class="container">
			<h1>Project Advantages & its Impact</h1>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Improving Management Efficiency</strong> <br>Adding the proposed functionality will greatly
					increase the efficiency of license submissions, as it reduces the manual effort required to create
					and submit new licenses to the SPDX License List repository. The automatic creation of PRs and files
					such as the .txt test file can save significant time for the SPDX-legal team and contributors.</li>

				<li><strong>Improved Error Handling</strong> <br> By improving error handling, the online tool will be
					better equipped to handle exceptions and failures that occur during license submissions. This can
					reduce the time and effort required to troubleshoot and fix errors and can lead to smoother and more
					efficient workflows.</li>

				<li><strong>Better Testing</strong> <br> The addition of unit tests and GitHub API interaction tests
					with mock can improve the quality of the codebase and reduce the likelihood of errors or bugs. This
					can lead to a more robust and reliable online tool, which can benefit the SPDX-legal team and
					contributors in the long run.</li>

			</ul>
			Through careful planning and implementation of advanced features, we hope to achieve optimal results and
			establish the online tool as the go-to resource for license submissions in the industry. These improvements
			will not only make the tool more user-friendly but also ensure it can evolve over time.

	<!-- Future Scope -->
	<div class="work section second" id="futureScope">
		<div class="container">
			<h1>Future<br>Scope</h1>
			<p>
				I idenitified below items as part of Future scope, and could be incorporated:-
				<br>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Automatically archive or remove the license listing from the online tool UI, once the PR is
						merged</strong>
					Once a PR is merged, the GitHub webhook will trigger the API endpoint, which will extract the
					relevant information from the merged PR, including the license file name, SPDX identifier, and other
					metadata. The endpoint will then use this information to call the SPDX database API to update the
					license listing status to "archived".
				</li>
				<li><strong>Overhaul SPDX-Online-Tool’s Documentation</strong>
					With the help of my mentor, I would like to revamp SPDX-Online-Tool’s wiki and documentation and
					follow standardized guidelines to create documentation for developers as well as users.
					Documentation is a crucial component of any project which helps newcomers start contributing quickly
					and I feel we need improvement in that aspect (though an active and helpful community compensates
					for it at gitter).
